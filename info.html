                      Through the centuries, wine has been
                         a social event. From the harvest to
                          the new wine festivals, wine brings
                          people together. It has been our dream
                          to create a facility that brings to reality
                           a wine making experience for all who
                            want to participate. We have learned
                             a lot about what people like in their
                             wine making experience, and that people,
                              like their wine, appreciate a personal
                              and intimate touch. Our focus is on the
                               quality and personal care you and your wine
                               creation deserve. No mass production or factory
                                feels at Harmony Winery, if you’re not happy,
                                we’re not happy. Like people, wine is as individual
                                 as its creator. Through your own hands,
                                 you will bring to life your own vintage.
                                  It starts with a wine tasting session
                                   to decide which wine to make. Then we walk
                                   you through the process of making your own
                                   personalized vintage in our state-of-the-art
                                   wine studio. Each vintage will include everything
                                   you need: bottles, corks, seals and custom labels.
                                   Wine making is an enjoyable experience and custom
                                   label wine makes a wonderful gift for many occasions.
                                    For the wine lover and wine maker, this is a truly
                                    unique experience.
